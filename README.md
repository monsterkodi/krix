### about

krix is a simple [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/)-client for macOS.

It ...
- lives in the menu bar
- includes a tile based file browser
- displays a waveform of the current song
- assumes your music files are located in '~/Music'
- caches tags and images in hidden '.krix' folders

### setup

The waveforms are generated by the [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) command-line tools.
You can install them like this:
```sh
brew tap bbc/audiowaveform
brew install audiowaveform
brew install ffmpeg
```

The music player daemon might by installed by:
```sh
brew install mpd
brew install mpc
# copy the default config file and adjust it to your needs:
cp /usr/local/etc/mpd/mpd.conf ~/.mpdconf 
```
