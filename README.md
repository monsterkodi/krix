### about

krix is a simple [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/)-client for macOS.

It ...
- includes a tile based file browser
- adds a menu bar icon for fast access
- displays a waveform of the current song
- assumes your music files are located in '~/Music'
- caches tags and images in hidden '.krix' folders

### setup

The waveforms are generated by the [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform) command-line tool.
You can install it like this:
```sh
brew tap bbc/audiowaveform
brew install audiowaveform
```

The music player daemon might by installed by
```sh
brew install mpd
brew install mpc
cp /usr/local/etc/mpd/mpd.conf ~/.mpdconf
```
